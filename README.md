A simple API with user, chat, and chat message management.

Built to the API spec defined [here](http://docs.oracodechallenge.apiary.io/#reference/endpoints).

### Requirements

- .NET Core v1.0.0.

### Obvious improvements:

- Enable and force HTTPS
- Use Entity Framework for model persistence (currently using in-memory storage)
- Better auth integration (bearer token solution felt a bit hacky)
- More defensive programming
